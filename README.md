**<H1>Cyberbullying Detection with NLP</H1>**  

**<H3>Abstract</H3>**

Cyberbullying is a growing problem across digital platforms. This project leverages BERT to detect cyberbullying in English. Using deep learning-based text classification, our model can differentiate between offensive, neutral, and bullying language with context-awareness, improving upon traditional keyword-based filtering.  

**<H3>Key Features</H3>**  
✅ Context-Aware Detection: Understands offensive words in different contexts  
✅ Real-Time Classification: Fast inference for real-time chat moderation and social media monitoring.  
✅ Profanity Filtering: Classifies profanity into categories (mild, strong, offensive).  
✅ Customizable Deployment: Can be integrated into web apps, chatbots, and APIs.
